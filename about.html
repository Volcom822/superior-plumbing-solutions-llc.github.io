  <h1>About Superior Plumbing Solutions LLC</h1>

  <p>Welcome to Superior Plumbing Solutions LLC — where dependable service meets exceptional quality. Based here in the <strong>Charleston area of South Carolina</strong>, we’re a small, family-run business that prides itself on treating every customer like a neighbor, not just a number.</p>

  <p>My name’s Chris, and I founded this company with one goal in mind: provide honest, high-quality plumbing services without the sales pitch. I’ve worked in this industry for <strong>almost 15 years</strong>, and I’ve seen the good, the bad, and the overpriced. I wanted to do it differently — fair prices, real communication, and top-tier workmanship.</p>

  <p>Whether you’re dealing with a clogged drain, a failing water heater, or planning a full plumbing system for your home build, we’ve got the tools and the experience to handle it all. We specialize in <strong>residential plumbing, water heater installations (tank & tankless), fixture replacements, and full plumbing remodels</strong>.</p>

  <p>Thanks for considering us. We look forward to earning your trust one job at a time.</p>
